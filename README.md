# myBin2
It's a "bin" directory where I store very useful little scripts. Why does myBIN exist?:
 - Because it is an easy way to use and store my own scripts.
 - Because it is a great way to improve the possibilities that UNIX allows me.
 - Because this way these scripts can be improved, the base of others or help to create new ones.

## Pre requirements ##
Have a Linux OS or Mac OS:
 - You must copy or link the folder "bin" in your home so that it remains "$HOME/bin" .
 - If this line ( PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH" ) does not exist in your "~/.profile" file, add it.
 - python3.

## Post-discharge ##
Unzip the "bin" directory to "~/bin". This together with the previous steps will allow you to launch these scripts from your terminal at any time.
